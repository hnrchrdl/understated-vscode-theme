Thanks to Sarah Drasner, for writing this [blog post about vscode theme creation](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/) and the demos that I copied over from her [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) theme.

This palette was inspired in part by the British Palette [Theme](https://flatuicolors.com/palette/gb).
